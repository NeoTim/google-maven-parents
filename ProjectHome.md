This is the official Maven repository for Google open source projects.

**NOTE:** This is not a general-purpose repository.  Artifacts deployed to this repository must come from projects with the [Google](http://code.google.com/hosting/search?q=label:Google) label,  If you are a code.google.com project owner looking to deploy a project to a repository, https://maven2-repository.dev.java.net/ may be a good option.
