# Where is my favorite Google project? #

All Google Open Source projects are encouraged to publish to the central maven repository (see [GuidelinesForGoogleMavenProjects](GuidelinesForGoogleMavenProjects.md)). You can search the central repo at http://oss.sonatype.org/.

If your favorite Google project is not available in the central repo, please file an issue with that project. Also, in the spirit of open source, you may [upload the project yourself](http://www.sonatype.com/people/2010/04/uploading-artifacts-to-the-central-maven-repository-diy/).
